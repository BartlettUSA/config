# Plan Before Edit

For non-trivial changes (>3 files or architectural impact):

1. **Run /plan first** - Establish scope and get approval
2. **Minimal change sets** - Prefer smaller, focused diffs
3. **No surprise dependencies** - Pause and ask before adding new packages
4. **Test coverage** - Plan includes test additions/updates

## Exceptions (direct edit OK)
- Typo fixes
- Single-line bug fixes with clear cause
- Documentation-only updates
- User explicitly said "just do it"
